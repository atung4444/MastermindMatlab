# MastermindMatlab
A project done in Matlab where I was tasked to recreate the game Mastermind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern version
with pegs was invented in the 1970s but the idea resembles an earlier pencil
and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century or more.
In Mastermind, one of the players is the codemaker and the other player is
the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a color pattern and the
codebreaker tries to guess the pattern in a number of turns
